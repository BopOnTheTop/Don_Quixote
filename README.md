# Don Quixote Bot

#### This is a simple (relatively) telegram bot, which is purposed specially for Me.
##### As a echo-bot, film-chooser(what?) and, maybe, a Deus Ex Machina for house automation.
If you would  like some features added to this project - feel free to fork and code.

### Description:

You are Sancho Panza. A quite simplistic, but though cunning farmer, which supports and serves
Don Quixote de Lamancha. Sometimes, You are the sound of wisdom in Don's head, trying to talk him over, in
order not to do stupid or simply dangerous things. Eventually, you noticed, that when you give an idea to  our
Alonso Kihano, and he'll be enchanted with it, he'll monitor things relentlessly.

This might be dangeous! Because our Don Quixote might forget to sleep and eat.
So you should care about him in order not to starve, dehidrate and etc.
You can get away from be too much obsessed by thinking about ideas and  monitoring stuff, with a simple chat.
He'll remember about his everyday needs and will do all the needed things independently.

But once upon time, you noticed, that you might specify him ideas, which enchants him.

That was the moment, when senor Sancho Panza appeared.
You work hard, for Alonso not to starve. And you can get some benefits, as it appeared.

Be **realistic** and wise, so the story of El ingenioso idalho don Quixote de LaMancha, and his brave squire, Senor
Sancho Panza, **continues**...
